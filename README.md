This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project import-package` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project import-package`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project import-package` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build import-package` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

After building your library with `ng build import-package`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/import-package` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test import-package` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
